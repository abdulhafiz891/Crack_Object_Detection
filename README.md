# Concrete_Crack_Transfer_Learning
Concrete_Crack_Transfer_Learning project. This project demonstrates how transfer learning can be utilized to train a deep learning model for image classification using Tensorflow library. The objective of the project is to classify images of concrete cracks by determining whether they are cracked or not, thus providing a binary classification.

## Explanation
The code provided is a Python script that demonstrates how to use transfer learning to train a deep learning model for image classification 
using the Tensorflow library. The code is divided into multiple sections, each of which is executed using the Jupyter Notebook's "cell" execution feature.

The script is written for classifying concrete crack images, it's divided into several sections (cells) as following:

## Acknowledgment 
We would like to acknowledge the use of the dataset provided by Mendeley Data in this project. The dataset contains a set of images of concrete cracks for classification. The availability of this dataset greatly helped in the development and evaluation of our image classification model. We express our gratitude to the creators of this dataset for making it publicly available and hope that it continues to be a valuable resource for the research community.
